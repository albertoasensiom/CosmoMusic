# Cosmo Music - README

## Overview
Cosmo Music is an innovative and educational video game designed to combine music learning with engaging gameplay. Built using robust and versatile technologies, Cosmo Music offers an immersive experience where players navigate a music-themed environment, interact with different elements, and enhance their musical understanding. This project lays a solid foundation for future enhancements and extended features.

## Key Features
- **Core Mechanics**: Players control a character that moves across a musical landscape, interacting with tiles that produce different notes and melodies.
- **Dynamic Enemies**: The game features enemy characters that challenge the player’s progression and must be avoided.
- **Musical Integration**: Each action within the game contributes to the soundtrack, creating a seamless and engaging musical environment.
- **Educational Value**: Cosmo Music helps players, especially non-musicians, recognize and learn different musical notes through interactive gameplay.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Used as the main programming language for handling core mechanics, character movement, and game logic.
- **libGDX**: The primary game development framework utilized for rendering graphics, managing user input, and supporting cross-platform functionality.
- **Eclipse IDE**: Used for code development, debugging, and project management.
- **Gradle**: Employed for build automation and dependency management, ensuring a smooth development process.
- **Ableton 11**: Used for composing the game’s soundtrack, incorporating retro-style music elements to enhance the game’s ambiance.

## Project Structure
The main gameplay is controlled through the `GameScreen` class, which handles rendering, user input, and updates. An `Enemy` class is implemented to manage enemy behavior and interactions.
